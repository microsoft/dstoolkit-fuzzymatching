# Knowledge Graphs

Also referred to as: semantic knowledge graphs, enterprise knowledge graphs, semantic data lake

## Opportunity

Knowledge graphs allow you organize unstructured and structured data in a contextually aware, domain-specific graph.

## Value Statement

Uncover derived insights from large volumes of domain-specific structured and unstructured data sources to be able to answer more complex, contextually-aware questions from an organization's data. Examples of insights include:

- contextually-aware recommendations
- improved organization search, connecting employees to associated documents, M365 data, organizational hierarchy, and more ([Microsoft Search in Bing](https://www.bing.com/business/explore))
- contextually aware and more personalized people matching, and intelligent bot scenarios that take advantage of derived insights
- better alignment of structured and unstructured data sources
- increased transparency and visualization capabilities into the connections between organizational data
